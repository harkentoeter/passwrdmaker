the program uses the following components:

1. `create_password` function: This function generates a password of the specified length by alternating between 
uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The function uses a conditional statement to 
select a random character from each category based on its position in the password string.
2. `hussle_order` function: This function applies Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to the generated password string. 
It iterates through the string from the end to the beginning, swapping each character with a randomly selected 
character within the unsorted range. This results in more random permutations of the generated password.
3. `srand` and `rand` functions: These are used to seed and generate pseudorandom numbers for the Fisher-Yates 
shuffle algorithm. The `srand(time(NULL))` function seeds the random number generator with the current time, 
ensuring that the program generates a new set of random numbers each time it runs.
4. Input/Output: The program prompts the user to enter the desired password length and then outputs the generated 
password in a human-readable format.

The code is written using C programming language, which provides low-level control over memory management, making 
it suitable for performance-critical applications such as this password generator. This version of the program has 
been updated with improved safety and readability features, including the use of `const` qualifiers to prevent 
unintentional modifications of input parameters and string constants.

Overall, this C program is a powerful tool for generating complex passwords that can be used for various security 
applications such as user authentication or file protection.
